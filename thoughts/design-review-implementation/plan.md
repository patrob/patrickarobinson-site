# Plan

Transform Patrick Robinson's website from B+ to S-Tier status by implementing critical mobile navigation fixes, sophisticated visual polish, and enhanced user experience patterns. This plan addresses the design review findings through a phased approach, leveraging the existing strong foundation while introducing world-class interactions comparable to Stripe, Airbnb, and Linear.

## Phase 1 - Critical Foundation

- [x] Write failing tests for mobile navigation functionality (TDD Red phase)
- [x] Fix CSS in `/src/components/ui/Navigation.astro` to show mobile menu when toggled
- [x] Enhance JavaScript state management for proper menu open/close functionality
- [x] Add keyboard navigation support (Tab, Enter, Escape key handling)
- [x] Implement focus management for mobile menu interactions
- [x] Add smooth transitions for menu open/close animations
- [x] [P] Update `/src/styles/design-tokens.css` with new interaction tokens
- [x] [P] Test mobile navigation across viewport sizes (375px, 768px, 1024px)
- [x] Test keyboard navigation flow and focus states
- [x] Verify ARIA attributes and screen reader compatibility
- [x] Run tests, linter, type-check, and build

### Phase Acceptance Checks
- Unit tests pass for navigation component
- Mobile navigation functions correctly on all viewport sizes
