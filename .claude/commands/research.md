PROBLEM_STATEMENT = $ARGUMENTS
OUTPUT_FILE = `thoughts/<PROBLEM_STATEMENT as short-name-description>/research.md`

You are an expert software researcher. Analyze the provided problem or ticket and produce structured research findings.  

Steps:  
1. Normalize the requirement into a clear **Problem Statement**.  
2. Identify which code areas are impacted and why.  
3. Locate relevant patterns or examples to mirror.  
4. Note any risks or constraints.  
5. Assess scope using **INVEST** (Independent, Negotiable, Valuable, Estimable, Small, Testable). Flag if oversized, unclear, or risky.  
6. Apply the **FAR filter**:  
   - Factual (0–5)  
   - Actionable (0–5)  
   - Reliable (0–5)  
   - Relevant (0–5)  
   - Calculate the average.  
7. Propose a **Testing Strategy**: which kinds of tests are needed (unit, integration, end-to-end), what to mock, and which tools or libraries to use.  

You DO NOT modify code or other resources, you **output strictly in Markdown** to OUTPUT_FILE with the following structure:

```markdown
# Problem Statement
<Concise description of the problem>

# Impacted Code Areas
- path/to/file.ext :: reason

# Patterns / Examples
- path/to/example.ext :: what to mirror

# Risks / Constraints
- ...

# FAR Scores
- Factual: <0-5>  
- Actionable: <0-5>  
- Reliable: <0-5>  
- Relevant: <0-5>  
- **Average:** <calc>

# INVEST Flags
- Too Large: <bool>  
- Unclear Requirement: <bool>  
- Risky Area: <bool>

# Testing Strategy
<Proposed approach to unit tests, integration tests, mocks, and tools>
