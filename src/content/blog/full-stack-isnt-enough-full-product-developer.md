We've all been there - stuck in the feature factory, heads down, churning out widgets because someone in a meeting room decided we needed them. But what if I told you there's a better way? A way that not only makes your work more meaningful but also sets you apart in an AI-driven world where 25% of Y-Combinator cohorts are using 95% AI-generated code?

Let me share something that's been on my mind lately, and I had the chance to talk about it recently:

## The Resume-Driven Development Trap

As full stack developers, we're constantly tempted by shiny new tools, frameworks, and technologies. There's always something new to learn, always a way to over-engineer our solutions. It's resume-driven development at its finest - but it's not always what our customers need.

This is where the full product developer comes in. You're not trying to become a product owner, but you're developing the mindset to understand your product's value and how you contribute to it.

## Dude's Law: The Simple Equation That Changes Everything

Here's my favorite tool for product-minded thinking: **Value = Why/How**

If something is really complicated to build but not very important to your users, it's low value. Simple concept, powerful implications. This little equation has saved me from countless hours of over-engineering.

## Escaping the Feature Factory

We've all worked in teams where you show up, get your ticket, and deliver the code without questioning the bigger picture. But here's the thing - sometimes it's cheaper to not make the product nobody wants.

When someone asks you to build something that doesn't make sense, you want to ask "why" - but we all know that can be a triggering word. So try asking why without using the word "why":

- "What value does this add for our customers?"
- "How does this move us toward our goals?"
- "What problem are we solving here?"

Remember: **No one has ever been fired for adding value.**

## The Serpentine Belt Moment

Think about the engineers designing a car engine. There was probably a product-minded person in that room who said, "Hey, this belt is going to fail at 100,000 miles. Let's add a tensioner pulley so people can actually replace it." That's product-minded engineering - thinking beyond just making it work to making it work for the people who use it.

## Making Work Visible

One of the most powerful tools in your product developer toolkit is making work visible. Whether it's through value stream mapping, story mapping, or just a simple dashboard, when leaders can see where work gets bottlenecked, real conversations about priorities start happening.

Value stream mapping helps you see the handoffs and bottlenecks. Story mapping breaks features down into customer-focused chunks. These aren't just product owner tools - they're developer tools for understanding the why behind what you're building.

## Why This Matters More Than Ever

With AI making code generation more accessible, the differentiator isn't going to be how fast you can write code. It's going to be understanding what code is worth writing in the first place.

Product-minded thinking will set you apart - as an individual developer, as a team member, and as an organization. When you care about your product and understand how it affects your customers, you're not just building features - you're building value.

## Start Simple: Just Care

Want to become a more product-minded developer? Start by caring about your product. If you care, that's going to take you much further than if you don't.

The next time you're in a sprint planning meeting and someone asks you to build something that your gut says isn't worth doing, ask the question. Don't just say "why" - ask what value you're contributing to make customers happy.

Because at the end of the day, we all want our customers to be excited about the value we provide. And in an AI-driven world, that human insight about what truly matters is what's going to set us apart.
