Welcome to my new website built with Astro! This is my first post, and I'm excited to share my thoughts on web development, technology, and other topics that interest me.

## Why Astro?

I chose Astro for this website because:

- **Performance**: Astro generates static HTML by default, making sites incredibly fast
- **Developer Experience**: Great TypeScript support and modern tooling
- **Flexibility**: Can integrate with React, Vue, Svelte, or any other framework when needed
- **SEO Friendly**: Static generation means excellent SEO out of the box

## What to Expect

I'll be writing about:

- Web development best practices
- New technologies and frameworks
- Personal projects and learnings
- Industry insights and trends

Stay tuned for more content!
